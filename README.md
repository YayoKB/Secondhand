# WEDE-POE

## This is a tertiary project for WEDE5020.

We were tasked to create a website for an NGO, NPO or small business/organisation of our choice.

Our objectives were to create a responsive, well-designed website that will create a web presence for our chosen organisation.

## Second Hand Thrift

Second Hand Thrift (Fest) is an organised event run by Laura Rainbird and held in various areas across Cape Town. I chose it because they only had a Facebook page acting as their main web presence.

The main theme I went for was earthy greens and browns due to the fact that thrifting is meant to be better for the environment than buying newly produced clothing and items.
